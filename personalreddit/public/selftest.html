<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Like the title says, if you look at earlier history empires just fought against each other for mostly territorial expansion. But if you look at later history like ww1 that is where I think the good guys vs bad guys mentality is starting. The germans were portrayed as aggressive bad guys. And ww2 is where I think the peak of good guys vs bad guys mentality comes at play. The allies liberating east asia and europe from the axis powers. The soviets are also not being portrayed as the good guys in the cold war. I would just like to know how it started. (Im sorry for my bad english, its not my main language)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->
